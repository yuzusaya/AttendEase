# What is AttendEase?

AttendEase is a system built on top of FM-net and DigiSheet, designed to automate the attendance process across both platforms. It (will) supports multiple operating systems, including Android, iOS, and Windows (available as both a console app and an app with a graphical user interface).

# How does it works?

There are two ways to implement:

1. Api will be faster since only the required information is returned.
2. Simulation of user interaction through selenium. This method used headless browser to simulate the user interaction.
