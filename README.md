**What is AttendEase?**
AttendEase is a system built on top of FM-net and DigiSheet, designed to automate the attendance process across both platforms. It supports multiple operating systems, including Android, iOS, and Windows (available as both a console app and an app with a graphical user interface). 

**How does it works**
There are two ways to implement:
1. Api
   Api will be faster since only the required information is returned.

2. Simulation of user interaction through selenium
   This method used headless browser to simulate the user interaction.
